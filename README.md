# BlueBikes-Database
Blue Bikes Database System is a database management system designed to support the operations of a bike-sharing program. This system is built to handle large amounts of data related to bike rentals, maintenance, and other aspects of the bike-sharing program.

# Project Description
The Blue Bikes database system is a comprehensive database management system designed to store and manage data related to bike rentals and bike stations for the Blue Bikes bike sharing service. The system is built using Microsoft SQL Server and includes 12 tables that capture various aspects of the bike rental process, such as customer data, bike locations, trip histories, and more.
